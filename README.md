# OpenAI integration in Nextcloud

This app includes 3 custom smart pickers for Nextcloud:
* ChatGPT answers
* DALLÂ·E 2 images
* Whisper dictation

It also implements

* a Translation provider (using ChatGPT)
* a SpeechToText provider (using Whisper)

Instead of connecting to the OpenAI API for these, you can also connect to a self-hosted LocalAI instance.
